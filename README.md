Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of A.I. focused on processing and interpreting the human language. There are various tactics used to do this such as tokenization, lemmatization/stemming, parsing, and “Stop Word” removal. NLP can be used for text summary & extraction, language generation & completion, and/or text classification. In text classification, there is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis helps determine the emotion of a piece of text. This form of analysis is very useful for employee review and surveys as it can be difficult to effectively summarize large amounts of open response data. Common sentiment analysis approaches include the normal machine learning method using a training and testing dataset. While the other approach, is a lexicon-based approach. This approach focuses more on single word comparisons to determine emotion. Regardless of which approach is picked, sentiment analysis in itself is very difficult to get fully right. Datasets tend to be very large creating long wait times in programs, and, more importantly, language is so fluid it makes it difficult to get a model that fully captures every nuance that may exist.
